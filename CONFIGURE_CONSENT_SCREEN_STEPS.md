# Configure OAuth Consent Screen - Step by Step

## The Issue
The OAuth consent screen hasn't been configured yet, so you keep seeing "OAuth Overview" with just metrics.

## Solution: Configure the Consent Screen First

### Step 1: Go to OAuth Consent Screen
1. In the left sidebar, click "APIs & Services"
2. Click "OAuth consent screen"
3. You'll see "OAuth Overview"

### Step 2: Find the "Configure Consent Screen" Button
On the "OAuth Overview" page, look for:

**Option A: Button in the Center**
- A button that says "CONFIGURE CONSENT SCREEN"
- Or "GET STARTED"
- Click it!

**Option B: Empty State Message**
- Text that says "OAuth consent screen is not configured"
- With a button to configure it

**Option C: Top of Page**
- A button/link at the top that says "Configure" or "Edit"

### Step 3: If You Can't Find the Button
1. **Check the entire page** - scroll up and down
2. **Search the page**: Press Cmd+F and search for "configure"
3. **Look for any blue buttons** or "Create" buttons
4. **Check if there's a card/section** that says "Get Started" or "Configure"

## What to Do Now

1. Go to "OAuth consent screen" (left sidebar)
2. On the "OAuth Overview" page, **carefully look for ANY button** that mentions:
   - "Configure"
   - "Create"
   - "Get Started"
   - "Set up"
3. Click that button!

## If You Still Can't Find It

The button might be in a different location. Please tell me:
- Do you see ANY buttons on the "OAuth Overview" page? (What do they say?)
- Is there any text that mentions "configure" or "not configured"?
- What's in the CENTER of the page? (Not just metrics - anything else?)
