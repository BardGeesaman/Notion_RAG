# What Do You See on OAuth Overview Page?

## You're On the Right Page! ✅

You're at the OAuth consent screen. Now I need to know what's on the page.

## Look at the CENTER of the Page

Ignore the left sidebar and top tabs for now. Focus on the **main content area in the center**.

## What's There?

### Option 1: A Button
Do you see a button? What does it say?
- "CONFIGURE CONSENT SCREEN"
- "EDIT APP" 
- "PUBLISH APP"
- Something else?

### Option 2: Configuration Form
Do you see a form with fields like:
- App name
- User support email
- Developer contact
- etc.?

### Option 3: Information/Status Text
Do you see text that says:
- "Before you can publish..."
- "This app is in testing..."
- "No test users added..."
- Something else?

### Option 4: Tabs in the Content Area
Do you see tabs in the main content (not the top navigation)?
- App information
- Scopes
- Test users
- etc.?

## Also Check: Are There Tabs at the Top?

Look at the TOP of the page (near "OAuth Overview"). Do you see tabs there?
- What are they called?

## Tell Me:

1. What do you see in the CENTER/MIDDLE of the page?
2. What do you see at the TOP of the page (any tabs)?

Copy/paste any text you see, or describe what buttons/forms/tabs are visible!
