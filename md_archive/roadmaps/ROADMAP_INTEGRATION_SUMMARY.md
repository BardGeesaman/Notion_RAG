## 🔄 Integration Decisions

### **1. Merged Overlapping Items**

- **Signature Discovery**: Combined my "Automated Signature Discovery" with ChatGPT's "Automatic Signature Discovery" → Tier 2.1
- **Enrichment Analysis**: Integrated ChatGPT's enrichment module with my Pathway Analysis → Tier 2.5
- **Feature Caching**: My dataset feature caching + ChatGPT's feature lookup caching → Tier 1.1 + Tier 3.4
- **Validation**: Combined my signature validation with ChatGPT's model-based validation → Tier 3.2

### **2. Promoted High-Value Items**

- **Batch Ingestion Framework**: Promoted from ChatGPT's medium priority to **Tier 1** (immediate value)
- **Evidence Reports**: Placed in **Tier 2** (strategic capability)

### **3. Organized by Value**

- **Tier 1**: Immediate performance/operations wins
- **Tier 2**: Strategic capabilities requiring more work
- **Tier 3**: Quality improvements and optimizations
- **Tier 4**: Optional dashboards/visualizations
- **Tier 5**: Stretch goals for future

### **4. Preserved All Details**

- All ChatGPT roadmap items included
- All strategic analysis items included
- No items lost or ignored
- Enhanced with implementation details
