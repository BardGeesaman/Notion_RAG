# Check What You're Seeing on OAuth Page

You're seeing sidebar items like:
- Overview
- Branding
- Audience
- Clients
- Data access
- Verification center
- Settings

**This IS the OAuth consent screen page!** Those are the configuration sections.

## What to Look For

### In the Main Content Area (center/top of page):

1. **Page Title**: Should say "OAuth consent screen" at the top

2. **If NOT configured yet**, you'll see:
   - A button that says "CONFIGURE CONSENT SCREEN" or "CREATE"
   - Or a form asking you to select "User Type" (External/Internal)

3. **If ALREADY configured**, you'll see:
   - App name field (might be empty or have a name)
   - Configuration tabs/form fields
   - Status showing "Testing" or similar

## What to Do

1. **Click "Overview"** in the sidebar (if not already selected)
2. **Look at the main content** - what do you see?
   - Is there a form/fields to fill in?
   - Is there a button to configure?
   - Is it already partially filled out?

## Tell Me What You See

Describe what's in the **main content area** (not the sidebar):
- Any forms or fields?
- Any buttons?
- What does it say at the top?
