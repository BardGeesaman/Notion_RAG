# Mission

## Scientific Mission

Amprenta exists to accelerate discovery and validation of mechanisms and interventions for neurodegeneration by focusing on **ceramide/sphingolipid dysregulation**.

- **Focus**: Ceramide and broader sphingolipid pathway disruption in neurodegenerative disease.
- **Hypothesis**: Disruption of sphingolipid metabolism contributes to pathogenesis and progression in **ALS, Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer’s**, and is reflected as consistent, multi-modal molecular signatures.
- **Approach**: Use **multi-omics integration** (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics) to:
  - identify reproducible molecular signatures,
  - connect signatures to pathways and targets,
  - prioritize testable drug targets and chemical matter for follow-up.

## Business Goals

- **Accelerate the drug discovery timeline** by shortening the loop from hypothesis → evidence → experiment → decision.
- **Reduce time-to-insight for research scientists** by making data ingestion, exploration, and synthesis fast and reliable.
- **Enable data-driven decision making** with auditable evidence (sources, citations, reproducible analyses).
- **Build a comprehensive, evolving knowledge base** that unifies internal experiments, public datasets, and scientific literature.

## Target Users

- **Research scientists**: biology and chemistry teams working on disease mechanisms and interventions.
- **Drug discovery teams**: cross-functional groups tracking targets, assays, compounds, and progression from HTS to lead optimization.
- **Data scientists / bioinformaticians**: teams integrating datasets, building analyses, and validating signatures across modalities.

## Key Use Cases

- **Ingest and integrate multi-omics datasets** from internal experiments and public repositories.
- **Discover and validate molecular signatures** (cross-dataset recurrence, directionality, relevance).
- **Query the knowledge base with natural language** to synthesize insights across data and literature.
- **Generate evidence reports** for programs, experiments, datasets, signatures, and features.
- **Track compounds from HTS to lead optimization** with structure search, SAR workflows, and linkage to biology.
