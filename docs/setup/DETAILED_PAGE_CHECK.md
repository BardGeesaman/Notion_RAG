# Detailed Check of OAuth Overview Page

## You're on the Right Page!

The "OAuth Overview" page IS the OAuth consent screen page - we just need to find how to access the configuration.

## Please Check These Areas:

### Area 1: Top of Page (Above "OAuth Overview")
Look carefully at the TOP of the page content area. Do you see:
- [ ] Horizontal tabs/links? (What do they say?)
- [ ] A button? (What does it say?)
- [ ] Navigation breadcrumbs?
- [ ] Nothing visible?

### Area 2: Next to "OAuth Overview" Heading
Look to the LEFT and RIGHT of "OAuth Overview" text:
- [ ] Any clickable links/buttons?
- [ ] Any icons?
- [ ] Nothing?

### Area 3: Search the Page
1. Press **Cmd+F** (Mac) or **Ctrl+F** (Windows)
2. Search for: `test users`
3. Does it find anything? (What does it highlight?)

4. Search for: `app information`
5. Does it find anything?

6. Search for: `configure`
7. Does it find anything?

### Area 4: Check if Consent Screen is Configured
On the "OAuth Overview" page, do you see:
- [ ] An app name displayed anywhere?
- [ ] Status that says "Testing" or "Published"?
- [ ] Information about scopes?
- [ ] Just metrics/charts only?

## Alternative: Try Direct URL to Test Users

Try this URL (might work if configured):
```
https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent/testusers?project=amprenta-email-ingestor
```

## What I Need From You:

Please describe EVERYTHING you see on the "OAuth Overview" page:
1. Everything from the TOP of the page down to "Metrics"
2. Any tabs, buttons, links, or clickable elements
3. What happens when you search for "test users" on the page
