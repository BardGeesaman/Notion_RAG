# Find the Edit/Configure Button

## You're on the OAuth Overview Dashboard

If you keep seeing "OAuth Overview" and "Metrics", you're on the dashboard. We need to find the configuration/edit button.

## Look For These:

### 1. At the Top of the Page
Look at the TOP of the page (near "OAuth Overview" heading):

- Is there an **"EDIT APP"** button?
- Is there a **"CONFIGURE"** button?
- Is there a **"SETTINGS"** gear icon?
- Any button/link that says "Edit", "Configure", or "Settings"?

### 2. In the Left Sidebar
Look at the LEFT SIDEBAR menu. Do you see:
- "OAuth consent screen" with a submenu?
  - Click it - maybe it expands to show:
    - Configuration
    - App information
    - Scopes
    - Test users
- Any other menu items related to OAuth?

### 3. Tabs in the Content Area
Look at the MAIN CONTENT AREA. Are there tabs visible?
- Sometimes tabs appear after a heading
- Look for tabs like: "Overview", "Configuration", "Settings", etc.

### 4. Search for "Test users"
Try this:
1. Use Ctrl+F (or Cmd+F on Mac) to search the page
2. Search for: `test users`
3. Does it highlight anything? Click it if you can!

## Tell Me:

1. **At the TOP** - Do you see any buttons near "OAuth Overview"?
2. **In LEFT SIDEBAR** - What menu items do you see? (List them all)
3. **On the PAGE** - Press Ctrl+F (Cmd+F) and search for "test users" - does it find anything?
4. **Any tabs visible?** - Are there any tabs anywhere on the page?

## Alternative: Try This URL

Sometimes the configuration is at a slightly different URL. Try:
```
https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent?project=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

But first, let's find what buttons/tabs are visible on your current page!
