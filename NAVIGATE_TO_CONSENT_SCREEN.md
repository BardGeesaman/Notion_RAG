# Navigate to OAuth Consent Screen

## You're On the Wrong Page

If you see "Overview" as the first tab, you're on a different page (probably the Credentials page).

## How to Get to OAuth Consent Screen

### Option 1: Direct URL (Easiest)
Just paste this in your browser address bar:
```
https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent
```

### Option 2: Use Left Sidebar Navigation
1. Look at the **left sidebar** in Google Cloud Console
2. Find **"APIs & Services"** (it might be collapsed under a hamburger menu)
3. Click on **"APIs & Services"** to expand it
4. Click on **"OAuth consent screen"** (should be in the list)

### Option 3: Use Search
1. Look for a **search box** at the top of the page (usually says "Search products and resources")
2. Type: `oauth consent screen`
3. Click on the result that says "OAuth consent screen"

## What You Should See After Navigating

**If consent screen is NOT configured yet:**
- A big button in the center that says: **"CONFIGURE CONSENT SCREEN"**
- Click that button

**If consent screen IS already configured:**
- Tabs at the top:
  - App information
  - Scopes
  - Data access
  - Test users
  - Summary

## After You Get There

Once you see either:
- The "CONFIGURE CONSENT SCREEN" button, OR
- Tabs like "App information", "Scopes", "Test users"

...then we can proceed with the configuration!

## Tell Me
