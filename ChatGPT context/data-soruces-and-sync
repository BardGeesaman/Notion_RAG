# Data Sources & Sync Strategy

## 1. Data sources overview

- Notion
  - [DB name] – [short description]
  - [DB name] – [short description]
- Files
  - [Location] – [e.g. “Design docs folder in Drive”]
- Structured data
  - [DB / table / API] – [what it contains]

## 2. Sync policies

For each source, define:

- Sync frequency
- Incremental logic
- Owner (who can change config)

[Create a table-like list for each source.]

## 3. Access control implications

- Which sources are internal-only?
- Any sources that should NEVER be included in RAG?
